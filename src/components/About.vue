                        What can you expect from a Vue Vixens event? Well, as a student, perhaps new 
                        to the field of frontend development, you are given the opportunity to learn 
                        about Vue.js, a cool, fresh framework for building both web and mobile apps. Over 
                        the course of a day, you'll work with a mentor in small groups in a self-driven workshop.
                        You'll complete the task of building 
                        a web app and a mobile app that will teach about the framework and programming in JavaScript. 
                        You'll also get a chance to meet and work with like-minded students and interface with 
                        leaders in the industry - our mentors are often speakers at the conference you attend.

                        If you're joining a Vue Vixens skulk as a mentor, firstly, thank you! Because of you, we can offer
                        free workshops to new developers in a supportive environment. Your job is to stay with your mentees throughout
                        the day, helping them over any difficulties and giving them a view of the life of a seasoned professional 
                        developer. You're the best!
                      </p>

                        Unsure if you will fit into a Vue Vixens skulk? If you are a new Vue.js developer who uses the pronouns "she" or "they", you
                        are welcome. We hate to leave anyone out, but this group is for women, and those who identify as such. We are trans-friendly. 
                        The founder of Vue Vixens, Jen Looper, is a Wellesley College Alumna (class of '92) and takes the college's admission criteria 
                        as a blueprint. To paraphrase their statement of admissibility:
                      </p>
                      <p align="left">
                        "We will admit any person who lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman; therefore, candidates assigned male at birth 
                        who identify as women are eligible. We also welcome those who were assigned female at birth and who feel they belong in our community of women. 
                        We seek to provide students with a uniquely empowering learning environmentâ€”one designed specifically to prepare women to thrive in a complex world."
