                            <a href="https://medium.com/@jenlooper/introducing-vue-vixens-82a36455438a">Vue Vixens</a> is an initiative founded by <a href="http://www.jenlooper.com">Jen Looper</a>, Developer Advocate at 
                            <a href="http://www.progress.com">Progress</a>, that creates and hosts workshops to teach 
                            Vue.js to under-represented people in a cool and fun way. 
                            It is based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular 
                            community (<a href="http://www.ng-girls.org">ng-girls.org</a>) who was in turn 
                            inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives. 
                            The format involves self-driven code labs completed in a workshop format 
                            in groups with mentoring by conference-goers and speakers who volunteer to help. 
                            The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such 
                            with Vue.js in a supportive and inclusive environment. We also help conferences organize 
                            their diversity initiatives such as offering free conference tickets, and are building a scholarship 
                            fund to help offset those attendees' conference costs so that they can more easily attend.

                            What can you expect from a Vue Vixens event? Well, as a student, perhaps new
                            to the field of frontend development, you are given the opportunity to learn
                            about Vue.js, a cool, fresh framework for building both web and mobile apps. Over
                            the course of a breakfast, a lunch 'n' learn, or a full day, you'll work with a 
                            mentor in small groups in a self-driven workshop.
                            You'll complete the task of building
                            a web app and a mobile app that will teach you about the framework and programming in
                            JavaScript.
                            You'll also get a chance to meet and work with like-minded students and interface with
                            leaders in the industry - our mentors are often speakers at the conference you attend.

                            <b>A note to mentors</b>: if you're joining a Vue Vixens skulk as a mentor, firstly, thank
                            you! Because of you, we can offer
                            free workshops to new developers in a supportive environment. Your job is to stay with your
                            mentees throughout
                            the day, helping them over any difficulties and giving them a view of the life of a seasoned
                            professional
                            developer. You're the best!
                            Just to be clear, anyone can be a mentor for Vue Vixens! We are grateful for your participation.

                            <b>A note to students</b>: unsure if you will fit into a Vue Vixens skulk? If you are a new
                            Vue.js developer who uses the pronouns "she" or "they", you
                            are welcome. We hate to leave anyone out, but this group is for women, and those who
                            identify as such. We are trans-friendly.
                            The founder of Vue Vixens, Jen Looper, is a Wellesley College Alumna (class of '92) and
                            takes the college's admission criteria
                            as a blueprint. To paraphrase their statement of admissibility:
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                            "We will admit any person who lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman;
                            therefore, candidates assigned male at birth
                            who identify as women are eligible. We also welcome those who were assigned female at birth
                            and who feel they belong in our community of women.
                            We seek to provide students with a uniquely empowering learning environmentâ€”one designed
                            specifically to prepare women to thrive in a complex world."
